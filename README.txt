I got tired of having the same quote at the bottom of my email signature every day and didn't want to take the time to choose a new one periodically.

Sigmaker selects a random quote from its array of quotes and tacks it onto the bottom of your email signature.  You have to edit this program in to add your personal information to the sig file that you direct your email client to use.  After that, simply add it to your startup routine.

As an interesting aside, with the set of quotes that I use, this program has the weird habit of picking a quote that is very applicable to the day.  It gets downright freaky sometimes.

Notes: This program requires the Ruby interpreter and was tested with Ruby version 1.8.  Sigmaker is released under version 2 of the GPL (and only version 2).
